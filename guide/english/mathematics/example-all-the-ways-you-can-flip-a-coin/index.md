## Example All the Ways You Can Flip a Coin


In the experiment of flipping a coin, the mutually exclusive outcomes are the coin landing either heads up or tails up.

When we flip a coin a very large number of times, we find that we get half heads, and half tails. We conclude that the probability to flip a head is 1/2, and the probability to flip a tail is 1/2.



Let's consider flipping an **n** number of coin where we can enumerate all possible outcomes as follows, where H indicates a head, and T a tail:
* **n = 1** | H  T
* **n = 2** | HH  TT  HT
* **n = 3** | HHH THH HTH HHT HTT THT TTH  TTT
* **n = 4** | HHHH  THHH  HHHT  THHT  HHTH  THTH  HHTT  THTT  HTHH  TTHH  HTHT  TTHT  HTTH  TTTH  HTTT  TTTT

The formula of all possible outcomes of flipping a coin n number of times is 2 to the nth power.
